# Project Structure Explanation

This document provides an overview of the project structure for your Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA) developed with TypeScript.

## `public/`

The `public/` directory serves as the location for static assets that are directly accessible by the browser. It contains essential files for configuring and enhancing your PWA experience.

- **`manifest.json`**: A JSON file containing metadata about the PWA, such as its name, icons, and theme colors.
- **`icon.png`**: An image file used as the app icon across different platforms.

## `src/`

The `src/` directory is the core of your application's source code. It's where you'll organize your main codebase.

### `pages/`

The `pages/` directory houses your Next.js pages. These pages define the routes and content for your app. The `index.tsx` file, for example, serves as the default landing page.

### `components/`

In the `components/` directory, you'll store your reusable React components. For example, `Header.tsx` could be a component used consistently across various pages for navigation.

### `styles/`

Here, you'll manage your application's stylesheets. The `global.css` file can contain CSS rules applied globally, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your app.

### `utils/`

The `utils/` directory is the place for utility files serving different purposes within your application. For instance, `sw.ts` might contain the logic for your service worker.

## `next.config.js`

The `next.config.js` file is a pivotal component of your setup. It allows you to configure various settings related to the Next.js build process and deployment.

## `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file configures TypeScript's behavior within your project. It's where you specify how TypeScript compiles your code and interacts with your development environment.

## `package.json`

`package.json` is a fundamental file that lists your project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It's crucial for managing your project's development lifecycle.

Feel free to customize and expand this project structure as your PWA evolves. This initial structure provides a foundation for your Next.js PWA with TypeScript, and you can adapt it to your project's unique requirements.

**Note**: Ensure to keep your project documentation up-to-date as your project progresses.

### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
